AS3-LoLSkill-Game-LookUp
========================

This is an AS3 project for League of Legends active game look up.

I'm Argentinian and new here on github so everything you can teach me i will be glad!

About the project:

What it does?

Makes the user to fill a input text field with the summoner name and select a region.
Loads the LolSkill web with a URLLoader.
Parse the text with regExp.
Show the data as i want.
This is a beta, my idea it's develop this app to android but it has many users on Windows, so i'm making a simplified version for android and complete this for Windows.

Hope this helps, see you soon!
